AI assessment for TechPoint internship

"Situation

Given the launch of our food truck line, FoodX, we will be running an exciting and interactive promotion on college campuses to attract a massive initial student following. 
When placing their order on our fancy new FoodX app they input basic information about their college experience and we predict what they are going to order.  
If we donâ€™t get it right they get a 10% discount.
While the promotion has done a great job of bringing in business our staff has not been great at guessing orders and are not happy with the combined workload of guessing and cooking.
Because of this you have been asked to consider implications, solutions and deployment of a mechanism to automatically guess orders, sounds like the perfect job for AI!"
